# Multi Agency Data Model for Hounslow

## Overview

The Hounslow "Multi Agency Demand Management" (MADM) Tool is a system for Council Service Providers (internal or external) to upload cost data associated to service use (e.g. the cost of Temporary Accommodation / Adult Social Care) and run reports on that data.

It is a website with User Management / Authentication, File Upload Capabilities, and Online Reporting.

The tool collates the cost data and matches individuals across the different data sets, so that you can end up with a "Resident Index" and all costs associated to those Residents.

It runs analysis on the data and provides the following Online Reports:

* Total Spend by Resident
* Breakdown of Spend by Resident
* Total Spend by Service
